Acquire API keys from plaid

Creating Items
Use Link module to create items = (bank accounts, sign-in credentials)
Link passes a public_token that will later be exchanged for an access_token to the backend
This access_token and item_id identify the item
the access_token is used along with client_id and secret_client_id (API keys) to access into about items

Accessing info from Items
API endpoints access data from specific items using the item's access_token

POST /item/get
This endpoint inspects the status of item and provides all the types of info that are available to be displayed using the plaid API, and which endpoints you are currently using

To store plaid api data use a table to store the access_token and item_id as primary keys to an individual user

POST /transactions/get
POST /accounts/balance/get

Link
user creates item, this returns public_token
onSuccess() callback -a function in LINK- sends public_token to backend

/item/public_token/exchange
backend exchanges public_token (from LINK) with access_token and item_id

new public_token can be generated if old one expires (30 min) using the
POST /item/public_token/create     endpoint

access_token and item_id should be stored securely in database
